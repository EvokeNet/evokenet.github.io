# How to use

Evoke feed block can be added only on a page of a course. To add it you first need to enable edit mode(top right toggle), click to add a block(right blocks area), and finally choose to add the **Network Activity** block.

The block has two tabs:

- **My Group:** displays only actions related to users that is part of my team(group);
- **Network:** displays actions of all users of the course.

Evoke feed block shows the following users' achievements:

- **badges:** when a user receives a badge
- **comments:** when a user comments on a portfolio submission
- **likes:** when a user likes a portfolio submission
- **submissions:** when a user submits something

**Final note:** This block doesn't have any special settings, you just need to add it to the course to start seeing its information.
