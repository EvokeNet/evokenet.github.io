# How to use

### What is a course format?

A course format refers to the layout of a course, allowing different layouts and views for course activities.

A course format can be selected in the course settings.

### Evoke course format

Evoke project requires a special type of course format because activities can not be visible in the course page, but in the map block.

With the evoke course format, students only see the main area blocks, as you can see in the image below:

### Using Evoke course format on a course

If you wish to use evoke course format on a course, you first need to go the course settings and on the Course format area, choose Evoke format.

**VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you want to hide all activities for the students, you need to make sure you choose **Hide sections for students** in the **Course layout**.

Evoke course format was inpired on the Topics course format, because of this you can use it as topics, if you choose a different option on **Course layout**.

### Teachers and administrators

Teachers, site administrators and anyone who have permission to edit course settings can see all course activities, with edit mode enabled, they can add new activities and organize the content.

For those who have access, it is possible to manage the course as it is possible in topics course format.

### Course navigation index

Moodle 4.0 introduced a new way to users navigate through course topics and activities. It is a left navigation bar with all sections and its activities, users can go directly to any activity using this shortcut.

In order to follow Evoke flow and user experience, this navbar was removed from the course page and it is visible only inside an activity.

Another feature of Evoke is that the user can see only activities present on the same section of the current activity.

eg: Imagine that we have two sections with some activities on it.

| Section 1  | Section 2 |
|---|---|
| Activity A | Activity C |
| Activity B | Activity D |
|  | Activity E |

If we are viewing the Activity D, then we will see only activities from Section 2 in the course navigation index, in this case, we will see Activity C, D and E.
