### Configuring activities

All right! Now we have skills and Evocoins configured and the game is enabled in our course.

Let's proceed and configure activities skill points and Evocoins, after that, students will be able to receive skill points and Evocoins.

First let me remember you, to add a new activity in the course, or to edit an existing one, you first need to turn on edit mode(top right toggle button).

#### Activity form

When you are adding or editing an activity, the Evoke game fields will be visible at the end of the page.

Fields are grouped by their categories. It is possible to configure different skill points for different moments/actions.

Below you can see a table explaining how the points will be given to users based on the image above:

|  |
|---|
| **2** points of the skill vision when the user submit its evidence |
| **2** points of the skill curiosidad when the user submit its evidence |
|  |
| **4** points of the skill vision when the mentor comment on the user evidence |
| **4** points of the skill curiosidad when the mentor comment on the user evidence |
|  |
| Users will receive no points when the mentor evaluates their evidence. |
|  |
| When the activity be marked as complete, user will receive **5** Evocoins. |

That's all folks!

Now we have the Game installed, configured and ready to use.

The next pages will be explained additional and extra features of Evoke game, like the Evoke badges, user profile page, scoreboard, and more.
