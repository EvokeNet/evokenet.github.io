# Evoke pages

When we use an CMS like Wordpress it is very simple to create pages for our users, unfortunately Moodle doesn't have this feature easy and clearly. To handle that we create a feature called Evoke Pages.

To manage evoke pages you need to go to:

`Site administration > General > Evoke > Evoke pages`

Note you can create new pages, as you can view, edit or delete an existing one.

When you click to create a new page, the following form is presented:

![Evoke settings page creation](/img/local_evokesettings/settings3.png)

Here are all form fields explained:

- **Page title:** The title of your page;
- **Page slug:** The url of your page is composite by the page slug;
- **Show on menu?:** If you choose YES, a link to the page will be created in the primary top navbar;
- **Page content:** The HTML content of your page.
